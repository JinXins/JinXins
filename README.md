## Hi! Welcome to my GitHub 🥳

Hi, I'm Xin Jin, a Research Assistant at **Westlake University**. I received my Master's degree from **Chongqing Technology and Business University** and my Bachelor's degree from the **Pass College of Chongqing Technology and Business University**.

- 🔭 I’m interested in **Data Augmentation (Mixup)** and **Vein Identification (Palm-Vein)** research during 2022–2025. Currently, I’m exploring **MLLMs/LLMs**, with a focus on building efficient AI systems from both data-centric and model-centric perspectives. My goal is to develop scalable, robust, and efficient AI pipelines.
